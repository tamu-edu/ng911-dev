This repository is currently managed by the Texas A&M University (TAMU) Internet2 Technology Evaluation Center (ITEC).

## Purpose
This repo is used by the TAMU ITEC development team to create draft releases of conformance and end-to-end tests for the NG911 testing environment.  The rate of change should be low, but may be adjusted based on the completion of milestones within the project.  Once governance is transitioned to a self-sustaining group this will be further adapted for the long-term maintenance of the program.
