This repository is managed by the Texas A&M University System (TAMUS) Center for Applied Communications and Networks (CACN).

## Purpose
This repo is used by the TAMU CACN development team to share the NG9-1-1 Conformance and Interoperability Testing program code with the general public.  
Currently, development is performed in a different GitHub so that multiple (sometimes major) changes per day don't confuse the general public users.  Changes are pushed to this site on an as needed basis.  Once the initial versions of the code are ready for broad use, we expect to move to a more interactive environment on this GitHub, where we can accept pull requests and "Issues" (bugs reports or feature requests).
